# What is High Altitude Ballooning?

HAB is in essence, a platform to send what you want to near-space -- this can be a distance from as little as 60,000 feet to 120,000 feet. It is by far the cheapest way to get to this environment...

| Launch Costs | |
| --- | --- |
| HAB | $500 |
| High-Altitude Plane | $20,000 |
| Nanosat Launch | $100,000 |
| Sattellite Launch | $10,000,000 |

What can you do there?
 - **Science:** Explore the ozone layer, high altitudes, low pressure, cold temperatures, run experiments where there is much less aptmosphere.
 - **Photography:** Not only for incredible photographs demonstrating the curvature of the earth, but also things like tracking weather patterns, wildfires, farm growth, pollution. Our team also takes 360 degree video.
 - **Field Technology:** Balloons are a great way to test technologonies that may eventually end up in satellites, from communication equipment to reaction wheels.
 - **Innovate:** Beam internet down from balloons, carry cargo across the world, carry people to the edge of space, use telescopes beyond the messiness of the aptmosphere, launch rockets where they have to do a lot less work to get out of the aptmosphere.
 
 **The possibilities are endless.**
 
 ## HAB Basics

 The basic parts of a high altitude balloon, necessary for **EVERY** balloon launch
 - The balloon, which can weigh about 250g upwards, often passes 6 feet in diameter when filled on the ground and pop at 24 feet in diameter or more.
 - The radar reflector, no one likes hitting a plane.
 - The parachute, good for not breaking your payload, but also good for not breaking people or their property.
 - Paracord, often holds all of the above together.
 - GPS, so the balloon knows where it is.
 - Communication device, can be sattelite or radio transmitter, or even cellular network, so you know where the balloon is.
 - The helium, not uncommonly forgotten.
 
 Also,
 
 - [FAA approval](https://community.balloonchallenge.org/t/regulations-overview-including-contacting-the-us-faa/676)
 - [Flight simulations](http://predict.habhub.org/)
 - A good fielded launch location
 - 5 or more people to ensure smooth, but most importantly safe, launch operations.
