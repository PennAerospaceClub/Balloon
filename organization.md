# PAC's Balloon Team as an Organization
## Structure

Penn Aerospace Club has a mostly flat structure within build teams. Below is Balloon's org chart:

+ PAC Directors
  + Balloon Leads
    + Deputy Directors
    + Engineers

Our team is delimited primarily by functional units that define features of the platform:

| Subteam | Description |
| --- | :---------- |
| Core | Responsible for payload structure, integration, and required systems. Every other subteam will find themselves working very closely with Core to garauntee that the payload is built to support their subsystem and the reverse. |
| Altitude Control | Responsible for enabling the payload to support altitude-based maneuvers. This feature is important for gathering good data for experiments / photography and is the first step in enabling lateral manueverability. |
| Experiments | Responsible for carrying out scientific procedures that take advantage of HAB's access to high altitudes, cold temperatures, low pressure, and aptmospheric conditions. Part of successfully building out HAB as a platform is continually validating that it meets the needs of applications built on the platform. |
| Communications | Responsible for guaranteeing conistent 2-way communications throughout the flight. Being able to send and receive constant data streams and commands allows the team to cater to different autonomous needs and enable more complex, ground-based decisions. |
| Sensing / Imaging | Responsible for adding useful sensing data that extends the baseline data streams the platform provides. New integrations empower applications built on the platform and better imaging extends the clubs social reach and ability to provide novel experiences. |
