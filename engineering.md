This guide highlights basic concepts and practices for engineering on the team.

## Vision: Balloon as a platform (as a service)

Balloon teams can have numerous goals for their projects. A middle school launching small experiments on a balloon may have teaching students and exciting them about science as their primary mission. Some hobbyists may want to take incredible photos on their balloon. Google Loon wants to beam down internet to the entire world. The vision for Penn Aerospace Club can include all of these things, because we want to build ballooning as a platform to allow any project to happen.

If we look at any large scale balloon project, currently each team, anywhere in the world, is solving the same problems over and over again. How do we track our balloon? How do we gather data? How do we communicate and control our balloon? How can we garauntee mission assurance?

If we can build out a platform that allows our balloon platform to meet the demands of intensive science, photography, or experimental payloads, we can open up that platform and do much more than the team could do on its own. 

Early on in this team, we decided the most important needs of this platform:

1. Ensure safe launch and recovery; we must ensure that anything that goes on our payload wont be lost or damaged, especially if we must make people trust with expensive or delicate equipment.
2. Control sltitude, location, and time of flight; this ensures that we can run experiment through their whole life, or control to different variables, or monitor one location for an extended period, or ensure our balloon stays safe.
3. Continuously communicate with balloon; this allows us to get data in real time, and allows us to offload more desions to the ground than on the balloon. This can allow us to move compute and decision systems to the ground, allowing for more complicated systems. Also ensures recovery and safe transit.
4. Offer an extensive baseline suite of data available to any project built on the platform; everything from altitude to temperature, wind speed, pressure, light level, ozone content, location. This will allow those building on the platform to increase the scope of their project without having to build out these features themselves.
