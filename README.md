# Penn Aerospace Club's High Altitude Balloon Team

## Introduction
  Practiced by middle school students and NASA alike, high altitude ballooning is a cheap and effective way to get things off the ground and to near space. We are leveraging the ease of high altitude ballooning to create a powerful platform for all types of applications. Our team consists of students of all levels and backgrounds, from physicists and mathematicians to mechanical engineers and computer scientists. Members not only contribute to a cutting-edge platform, but have an opportunity to learn useful skills and get invaluable building experience.

## Guide
  This guide is meant to be an essential reference to new and current members about how this team works. As the team has grown and develop (and continues to), we slowly refine our team structure and engineering practices. Hence this guide remains public so that other build teams can either replicate the features of this team that suit them, or even make suggestions on how things should work.
